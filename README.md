=========
This is a small blog engine that in time will be extended by new features or things that I would like to test.

Currently is more hacker blog then engine – you need to do few things manually to get started.

It use RavenDB as database, MVC 4 (yeah right, a little bit of it) and few other things.

License
-

MIT - however keep in mind that whatever you do with it, you must compile to RavenDB licencing!

_If I not get licence properly, then the licence is what RavenDB licencing system required from OSS project. So if you are sure that MIT is wrong one, please let me know and I will change it to AGPL (I think that one is used by RavenDB)._
